## Tasks

When making the submissions, your repo's directory layout should be in this way:

- weatherfiles
- utils
- tasks
  - t1.py
  - t2.py
  - t3.py
  - t4.py
 

1. Find the year and temperature values for the minimum temperature. e.g. 2011 => -20
2. Find the year and temperature values for the maximum temperature. e.g. 2004 => 45
3. Find all the dates in which Max TemperatureC and Min TemperatureC has a difference of exactly 7.
4. Find all the unique events present in the files. (Events is the 2nd last column in files.)
5. Find all the months in which the event "Rain" occurred. (if the date is 2016-3-7, the month will be 3.)
